\chapter*{Summary}
Reading and understanding news articles takes time and effort and some readers are only interested in information that is relevant to them.
This Master-Thesis project demonstrates how a user, who is only interested in news about certain companies and topics, can retrieve such information from financial news articles in an efficient manner.\\

The project’s code extracts company names and their \gls{coref_definition} from the news text, classifies this text into different topic classes and stores this information in a Knowledge Graph.
This way, the user can retrieve the desired information and discover complex relationships by querying the Knowledge Graph or by communicating with the Knowledge Graph’s ChatBot (\gls{graph-bot}).\\

In the \emph{Information Extraction Pipeline}, different approaches were studied, implemented in code and compared with each other.
One of the key findings was that \glspl{gen-llm} can be used for a wide range of extraction tasks and that these models often outperform other, more traditional approaches.\\

Another key finding is that the retrieved information from the \gls{graph-bot} should also be more accurate than answers coming from a typical \gls{llm} ChatBot, even if that \gls{llm} ChatBot has a traditional \gls{RAG} system attached to it.
This is because the \gls{graph-bot}’s response is more based and focused on the stored news articles in the Knowledge Graph and less on next-word probabilities and vector similarities.\\

Such a Knowledge Graph can be seen as an alternative \gls{RAG} system that might replace the more commonly used vector databases there.
This is supported by a recently published and influential research paper by Microsoft \cite{graphrag} that points in the same direction.
